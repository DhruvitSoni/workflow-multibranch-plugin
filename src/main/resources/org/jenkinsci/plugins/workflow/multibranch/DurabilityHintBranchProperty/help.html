        This setting allows users to change the default durability mode for running Pipelines.  In most cases this is a
        trade-off between performance and the ability for running pipelines to resume after unplanned Jenkins outages.

        <br><br><strong>What does this do?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Previously, running pipelines wrote data constantly, so that they could resume even if Jenkins fails.
                This setting gives the user the ability to adjust this write behavior.</li>
            <li>Higher-performance/lower-durability modes write data to disk <strong>much</strong> less often for running pipelines.</li>
            <li>Writing data less often can massively reduce build times for Pipelines with many steps or complex logic.
                For pipelines which spend most of their time waiting for a shell/batch script to run, the difference will be less visible.</li>
            <li>Running pipelines with lower durability settings may lose data <strong>if</strong> they do not finish and Jenkins is not shut down gracefully:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A "graceful" shutdown is where Jenkins goes through a full shutdown process, such as visiting <code>http://[jenkins-server]/exit</code></li>
                <li>A "dirty" shutdown, such as using <code>kill -9</code> to terminate the Jenkins process, may prevent incomplete pipelines from persisting data</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pipelines that cannot persist data may not be able to resume or displayed in Blue Ocean/Stage View/etc.</li>
            <li>Pipelines will generally write log data regardless of durability settings.</li>
            <li>Some modes use an "atomic write" option - this helps ensure that pipeline build files aren't overwritten or left partially written if something fails.</li>
            <li>Atomic writes may place more stress on filesystems, so especially with networked storage it may be faster not to use them.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <strong>Note: </strong> defaults may be set globally under Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
